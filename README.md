# Homegaarden

# EE 183DB Final Project - Automated Hydroponics solution
# Ho(m)egaarden is a home-scale automated hydroponics bay which utilizes a sensor and actuator based feedback control system and can be housed in your living room. The sensing is controlled by pH, temperature, TDS and light sensors and the system is actuated by valves, an oxygen pump and an LED strip. The system is controlled by a mobile application providing human in the loop (HITL) control which allows for the maintenance of an optimal environment for crop growth. Our system is designed to be smart and cost-efficient, thus making it convenient for the everyday home-garden enthusiast.
